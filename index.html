                <h2>What is an Article?</h2>
                <p>An article is a short monosyllabic word that is used to define if the noun is specific or not. Articles are normally used before nouns and since they are used to speak about the noun, they can be considered as adjectives. </p>
                <p> Look at how various dictionaries define an article to have a much clearer idea of what they are.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>Definition of an Article</h2>
                <p>There are three articles in English – ‘a’, ‘an’ and ‘the’. These articles are divided into two types namely: </p>
                <li>Definite Artlce</li>
                <li>Indefinite Article</li>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
                <h2>Definite Article</h2>
                <p>Among the three articles, ‘the’ is said to be the definite article. A definite article is used to determine something that is specific or particular. It is also used before <span><a href="">plural nouns</a></span> and to indicate the <span><a href=""> superlative degree of comparison.</a></span>
                    Furthermore, it can be used before <span><a href="">collective nouns</a></span> as well. 
                </p>
                <p>For example:</p>
                <li>
                    <span>The</span>
                    Sun setes in 
                    <span>the</span>
                    west.
                </li>
                <p>In the above sentence, the nouns ‘Sun’ and ‘west’ are <span><a href="">proper nouns</a></span> and are specific and so the definite article has to be used.</p>
                <li>
                    <span>The</span>
                    children are playing crickete.
                    west.
                </li>
                <p> In the above sentence, the definite article is used to determine the plural noun, ‘children’.
                </p>
                <li>This is the world’s longest river.</li>
                <p>In the above sentence, the definite article is used to denote the superlative degree of comparison. </p>
                <li>
                    <span>The</span>
                    crowd sang along with the band.
                </li>
                <p>In the above sentence, the definite article is used before the collective nouns, ‘crowd’ and ‘band’. </p>
